# CLAHE Implementation

## What it does:
- reads all files from a folder named "input" (have to create it, if not already)
- applies the HE method on the images
- shows all the images in a opencv image viewer

## Things that can be modified:
- can change the behaviour of output: change it to output the modified images in a folder named
  output (have to create it, if not already), with custom filenames
- can change the clip limit: by changing the value in the variable `cliplimit`

## How to run:
duh?
